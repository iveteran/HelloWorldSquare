To remap the keyboard in KDE Plasma,

   Open the start menu
   Search for "Keyboard"
   Open the application the icon titled "Keyboard"
   Switch to the "Advanced" tab
   Look for "Ctrl position"
   Open the drop down menu and select "Swap Left Win with Left Ctrl"
   Click Apply

   This might work. I don't use that keyboard but
   from what I can tell command is the windows key.
