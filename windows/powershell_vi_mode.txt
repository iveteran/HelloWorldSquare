PowerShell Vim Mode

To enable Vim mode in PowerShell, you can use the PSReadLine module. This module provides a way to use Vim keybindings in PowerShell, similar to how you would in bash or zsh.

Install PSReadLine Module:
Install-Module PsReadline -Scope CurrentUser

Edit PowerShell Profile:
notepad $PROFILE

Add the following line to the profile:
```
Set-PSReadlineOption -EditMode vi
```

Reload the profile or restart PowerShell:
. $PROFILE

Now, you can use Vim keybindings in PowerShell. Press Esc to enter Normal mode or v to use Visual mode.

Important Considerations
Compatibility: Ensure you are using PowerShell version 3 or higher for the PSReadLine module to work correctly.
Profile Path: The profile path is typically located at C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.
Cursor Indicator: You can also set a cursor indicator to show whether you are in Normal or Insert mode by adding
```
Set-PSReadLineOption -ViModeIndicator Cursor
```
to your profile.

By following these steps, you can enjoy the efficiency of Vim keybindings while working in PowerShell.
