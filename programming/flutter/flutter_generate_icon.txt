Refer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43928702/how-to-change-the-application-launcher-icon-on-flutter

1) Install tool package
flutter pub add flutter_launcher_icons

2) creates directory
mkdir <PROJECT_ROOT>/assets
cp <YOUR-ICONS> <PROJECT_ROOT>/assets

3) Add below to pubspec.yml:
flutter_icons:
  image_path: "assets/icon.png"
  android: true
  ios: true
  # optionally, as transparency is not allowed on app store
  # remove_alpha_ios: true

4) Run tool to generate icon
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

PATCH:
In linux/runner/my_application.cc
add newline
gtk_window_set_icon_from_file(GTK_WINDOW(window),"assets/images/logo.png",NULL);
