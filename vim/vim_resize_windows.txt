Resize splits more quickly

You can use the :resize command or its shortcut :res to change the height of the window. To change the height to 60 rows, use:
:resize 60

You can also change the height in increments. To change the height by increments of 5, use:
:res +5
:res -5

You can use :vertical resize to change the width of the current window. To change the width to 80 columns, use:
:vertical resize 80

You can also change the width in increments. To change the width by increments of 5, use:
:vertical resize +5
:vertical resize -5


There are several window commands that allow you to do this:
    Ctrl+W +/-: increase/decrease height (ex. 20<C-w>+)
    Ctrl+W >/<: increase/decrease width (ex. 30<C-w><)
    Ctrl+W _: set height (ex. 50<C-w>_)
    Ctrl+W |: set width (ex. 50<C-w>|)
    Ctrl+W =: equalize width and height of all windows
